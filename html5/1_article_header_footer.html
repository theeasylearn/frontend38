                        Add cumin seeds: Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let

                        Cook tomatoes: Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy. <br>

                        Add vegetables: Add the boiled and mashed potatoes, cauliflower, chopped carrots, green peas,

                    <p>Mash the bhaji: Using a potato masher, mash the vegetables to a coarse paste. Add water as needed
                        to achieve the desired
                        consistency.</p>
                    <p>Simmer: Let the bhaji simmer for 10-15 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent
                    sticking to the pan.</p>
                    <p>
                        Finish with lemon and coriander: Add lemon juice and fresh coriander leaves. Mix well and cook for

                        coriander leaves, and a

                        Ensure the batter is fermented well for crispy dosas.
                        You can adjust the spice levels in the potato filling according to your preference.
                        For extra crispy dosas, you can add a little rice flour to the batter before making the dosas.
