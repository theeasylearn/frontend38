            Instructions
            Preparing the Bhaji:
            
            Heat oil and butter: In a large pan or skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
            
            Add cumin seeds: Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let them splutter.
            
            Sauté onions: Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
            
            Add ginger-garlic paste: Add 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste and the finely chopped green chilies. Sauté for a couple
            of minutes until the raw smell of the ginger-garlic paste disappears.
            
            Cook tomatoes: Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.
            
            Add vegetables: Add the boiled and mashed potatoes, cauliflower, chopped carrots, green peas, and bell peppers. Mix well
            and cook for a few minutes.
            
            Spice it up: Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, pav bhaji masala, and salt. Mix everything well and cook for 5-7
            minutes, stirring occasionally.
            
            Mash the bhaji: Using a potato masher, mash the vegetables to a coarse paste. Add water as needed to achieve the desired
            consistency.
            
            Simmer: Let the bhaji simmer for 10-15 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking to the pan.
            
            Finish with lemon and coriander: Add lemon juice and fresh coriander leaves. Mix well and cook for another minute.
            Adjust seasoning if needed.
            
            Preparing the Pav:
            
            Butter the pav: Slice the pav horizontally, but not all the way through. Heat a skillet or griddle and melt 2
            tablespoons of butter on it. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of pav bhaji masala over the melted butter.
            
            Toast the pav: Place the pav on the skillet, cut side down, and toast until they are golden and crispy.
            
            Serving:
            
            Serve hot: Serve the hot bhaji in a bowl, topped with a dollop of butter, chopped onions, fresh coriander leaves, and a
            lemon wedge on the side.
            
            Enjoy with pav: Serve the toasted pav alongside the bhaji. Enjoy your delicious Pav Bhaji!
            
            Tips:
            
            You can add more vegetables like beans or corn if you like.
            Adjust the spice levels according to your preference.
            For an extra rich flavor, you can add more butter to the bhaji while cooking.
            Pav Bhaji tastes best when served hot.
