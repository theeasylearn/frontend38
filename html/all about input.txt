type of form submission method
---------------------------------------------
Get method
    input is visible in address bar. 
    anyone software/user can change submitted input
    should be used only when user should be able to directly edit submitted input or bookmark url.
    get method only works with text input. can not work with binary input. 
    limit of input is 4KB. we can submit more then 4kb input. 

Post method 
    input is not visible in any manner. 
    anyone can not access/change input. 
    it works on both text and binary input. 
    there is not limit of post method set by html/browser itself.
